# keyfinder
This VBA function checks keywords of a list and returns corresponding value
I have a main list of companies in 1st sheet and keen to find each company in the next sheet. But the name of companies are not the same. 
So I created a column named Keywords in the 2nd sheet containing keywords of each name of companies.
With this function I can compare two column of companies' name.
